/*
   Build a query for validation errors based on joins and a where
   clause. The validations table will be aliased as `v`. Where clauses
   should use parameters starting at `$2`, as `$1` will be used by the
   `public_id`.

   For example: buildErrorQuery("INNER JOIN ballots b ON b.results_id = v.results_id AND b.id = v.identifier",
                                "b.id = $2 AND scope = 'ballots'");

   That will get a count of all error types for a specific ballot and
   example error data for each error type.
